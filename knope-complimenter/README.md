And general (bordering on manic) viewing of Parks & Recreation.

# Aim of the game
Generate a compliment meant for a friend. Compliments must praise behavioral traits through metaphors related to strength, intelligence, work ethic, beauty, etc. 

Users can enter their own friend's names and professions to generate a personalized compliment. If none are provided, the beautiful land-mermaid that is Ann Perkins receives more accolades. But beware! like life, sometimes, instead of a compliment, you may be handed a lemon in the form of April Ludgate (scary) or Jerry Gergich (useless).

# Compliment formats

By now, you may be aware that these compliments are an assortment of adjectives, nouns, natural phenomena, etc strung together seemingly randomly. I have chosen to employ the following formats to delve into the art of the metaphor and generate compliments:

(all properties in <> are to be randomly assigned)
1) <cute adjective>, <strong adjective>, <behavior> <cute/strong animal>
2) <adjective> <ecosystem>-<mythical being>
3) <adjective>, <behavior> <inanimate object> come to life
4) <adjective>, <adjective> <profession>
5) <adjective>, <adjective>, <flower>
6) <infuser>-infused <infusee/dessert>
7) Analagous comparisons:
    Lord of the Rings is the <person> of novels. 
    Waffles are the <person> of breakfast foods.

Where appropriate, <person> is prefixed/suffixed/inserted.

Note: As the aim is to generate compliments randomly, the format is also chosen randomly.

# API usage
The Merriam Webster Thesaurus API is employed to fetch synonyms for the adjectives mentioned above. Other compliment properties are randomly selected from hardcoded lists.

# Image usage
Images are stored in the repo and pulled randomly.
